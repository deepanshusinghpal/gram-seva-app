## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **üé® Modern & Responsive UI:** Built with React, the interface is clean, intuitive, and provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **üîê Secure User Authentication:** A complete JWT-based system for user registration and login. Passwords are fully encrypted using `bcrypt`.
-   **üõçÔ∏è Product Catalog & Search:** Users can view a list of available products and filter them in real-time with a dynamic search bar.

-   **üîó Smart Navigation:** The application correctly handles scrolling, automatically scrolling to the top on new pages and to specific sections when using anchor links.
